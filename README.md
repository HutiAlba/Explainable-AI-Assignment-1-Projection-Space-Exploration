# Explainable AI Assignment 1: Projection Space Exploration

In this assignment, you are challenged to analyze and compare solutions of a problem, game, algorithm, model, or anything else that can be represented by sequential states. For this, you will project the high-dimensional states to the two-dimensional space, connect the states, and add meta-data to the visualization.

Exemplary solutions are provided in the `solution_rubik.ipynb` and `solution_2048.ipynb` notebooks.

Further examples to analyze are (board) games and approximation algorithms. The 2048 notebook uses [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) to create a game environment and produce state data. There is a variety of first and third party environments for Gym that can be used.


### Dataset

Please add your dataset to the repository (or provide a link if it is too large) and answer the following questions about it:

- Which dataset are you using? What is it about?

  We are using a dataset for the game Go. Go is a game that involves two players alternately placing black and white stones on a board checkered by 19 vertical lines and 19 horizontal lines. The players attempt to conquer territory by surrounding vacant areas or capture stones by surrounding them.
  About our dataset: This dataset contains thousands of Go games played on the Go Server, a popular online Go platform. Each game record includes player moves, player ranks, game results, and metadata like game date and board size. The dataset is typically used to analyze gameplay patterns, study player strategies, and train machine learning models.Link to the Go Server: https://www.gokgs.com/.

  The structure of the used data as well as a data sample can be found in this GitHub repo in the following directory: data/GO_lazy-legends. The complete dataset is going to be uploaded later.

- Where did you get this dataset from (i.e., source of the dataset)? How was the dataset generated?
  Link to the Go Server: https://www.gokgs.com/

  The dataset was generated via live games, where every move of a player and outcome of the game was recorded. On the one hand, datasets were generated by games played by players which were listed in the TOP 100 users list of the GO website, and can therefore expected to be experienced GO players. We chose 38 games from this TOP 100 list.
  
  On the other hand, 6 games were generated by members of the group "Lazy Legends", which are complete beginners to the game. The site where we played the game and downloaded the .sgf files: https://shin.gokgs.com/play
  
   No AI was involved in the generation of the dataset.

- What is dataset size in terms of nodes, items, rows, columns, ...?

  - game_id: identification number for the given game, each unique game is defined by this id
  - move_id: individual step/move within the current game
  - player level: categorical level of the player's expertise (beginner, intermediate, master)
  - colour: colour assigned to the player (black/white) at each step
  - our players colour
  - winner color
  - result (score, resign, time)
  - rules: Japanese or Chinese
  - handycap: 0/4/...
  - step_count: sum of the total moves in 1 game
  - rank
  - Player name
  - Date
  - area total white: total number of area points achieved by the white player by the end of the game
  - area total black: total number of area points achieved by the black player by the end of the game
  - area result: final area result in points by the end of the game, indicating the difference in area control between players
  - area winner: colour of the player with the higher area score (black/white)
  - final result: score of the winner or resign
  - territory total white: total number of territory points achieved by the white player by the end of the game
  - territory total black: total number of territory points achieved by the black player by the end of the game
  - territory result: final territory result in points by the end of the game, indicating the difference in territory control between players
  - territory winner: colour of the player with the higher territory score (black/white)
  - A1: state of this cell on the board (1 - occupied by black, 2 - occupied by white, 0 - occupied by neither/empty)
  - A2: state of this cell on the board (1 - occupied by black, 2 - occupied by white, 0 - occupied by neither/empty)
  - A3: state of this cell on the board (1 - occupied by black, 2 - occupied by white, 0 - occupied by neither/empty)
  - ....
  - S17: state of this cell on the board (1 - occupied by black, 2 - occupied by white, 0 - occupied by neither/empty)
  - S18: state of this cell on the board (1 - occupied by black, 2 - occupied by white, 0 - occupied by neither/empty)
  - S19: state of this cell on the board (1 - occupied by black, 2 - occupied by white, 0 - occupied by neither/empty)

  Number of columns: 384

  Number of rows: 9755

- What do you want to analyze?
  - Compare different strategies of Go: compare how players of different expertise levels (beginner, intermediate, master) approach the game, for example in terms of territory and area control.
  - Compare how players start the game (which opening movements are present)
  - Which territories are occupied faster? What could be the reason for that? Can we see any patterns?
  - Identify potential winning factors by examining attributes of winning games and moves, such as player color (black/white advantage), sequence of moves, and scoring patterns, to be able to understand what strategies lead to victory
  - Evaluate territory acquisition strategies
  - Examine game state transitions, such as when players shift between offensive and defensive moves
  - Compare endgame board states to identify patterns in winning strategies and use of territory
- What are you expecting to see?
  - Different strategies by the expertise level of the players: master players might display more sophisticated strategies, for example focusing more on territory control or certain board sectors compared to beginners or intermediate players
  - Different opening trends: identification of popular opening sequences among different player ranks (beginner, intermediate, master).
  - Some patterns in win rates by the colour of the player
  - Identify some critical moves that increase or decrease win probability.
  - Positional importance of a certain cell on the board: some cells (for example near the edges or corners) might correlate with higher area or territory scores, reflecting strategic choices
  - Capture Strategies: Trends in how players capture stones or protect their groups based on rank.
  - Territory vs. Influence: Differences in focus on territory versus influence among players of various levels.

## Final Submission

- Make sure that you pushed your GitHub repository and not just committed it locally.
- Sending us an email with the code is not necessary.
- Update the _environment.yml_ file if you need additional libraries, otherwise the code is not executeable.
- Create a single, clearly named notebook with your solution, e.g. solution.ipynb.
- Save your final executed notebook as html (File > Download as > HTML) and add them to your repository.

## Development Environment

Checkout this repo and change into the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/jku-icg-classroom/xai_proj_space_2024-<GROUP_NAME>.git
cd xai_proj_space_2024-<GROUP_NAME>
```

Load the conda environment from the shared `environment.yml` file:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate xai_proj_space
```

> Hint: For more information on Anaconda and enviroments take a look at the README in our [tutorial repository](https://github.com/JKU-ICG/python-visualization-tutorial).

Then launch Jupyter Lab:

```
jupyter lab
```

Go to http://localhost:8888/ and open the _template_ notebook.

Alternatively, you can also work with [binder](https://mybinder.org/), [deepnote](https://deepnote.com/), [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), or any other service as long as the notebook runs in the standard Jupyter environment.
