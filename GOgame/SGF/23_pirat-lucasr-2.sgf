pirat [6d\]: lol
pirat [6d\]: ty
lucasr [5d\]: im 3d level now
pirat [6d\]: sad news(
lucasr [5d\]: too weak
pirat [6d\]: What's wrong with your game?
lucasr [5d\]: idk
lucasr [5d\]: jsut not playing well
lucasr [5d\]: against weaker players its fine
pirat [6d\]: I think it will pass over time
lucasr [5d\]: but against strong 5d/6d i will die easily
lucasr [5d\]: yes
lucasr [5d\]: sometimes i play really well like 6d level
lucasr [5d\]: and sometimes i play like 3/4d level
pirat [6d\]: You just need to wait until this period has passed
lucasr [5d\]: yes
lucasr [5d\]: now u can give me 2 handi easily in blitz
pirat [6d\]: big instability
lucasr [5d\]: yes:(
lucasr [5d\]: its also because of my play style
lucasr [5d\]: when i count read precisely my strength drops alot
pirat [6d\]: I do not know why my rating does not change, lately I have been winning everything
lucasr [5d\]: in fighting 1 wrong move is big differeence
lucasr [5d\]: u paly too many games
lucasr [5d\]: its hard for your rank to increase
pirat [6d\]: when?
lucasr [5d\]: if u create new account u will increasse fast
lucasr [5d\]: the more games u play the less each game means
pirat [6d\]: Unfortunately, many 8 dan refuse to play with me
lucasr [5d\]: when u get to 7d they will play u
lucasr [5d\]: i have to wait till this period pass
lucasr [5d\]: my calculation now is inaccurate
pirat [6d\]: I know, that's why I want to become one as soon as possible
lucasr [5d\]: when im in good form i can win most 5ds in fighting
pirat [6d\]: yes
lucasr [5d\]: but now my calculation is not accurate 
lucasr [5d\]: and too many overplays
lucasr [5d\]: :(
pirat [6d\]: Yes, it shows in your game
lucasr [5d\]: i think have to stop playing blitz for a whiel
lucasr [5d\]: for a while
lucasr [5d\]: especially against lower dans
pirat [6d\]: And when will you start?
lucasr [5d\]: i will top playing blitz for a while
lucasr [5d\]: will play slightly slower
lucasr [5d\]: stop playing blitz*
lucasr [5d\]: so slowest 20 sec/move
pirat [6d\]: This is a good option for you
lucasr [5d\]: 20 sec can at leasgt count
lucasr [5d\]: 10 sec is mostly feel
pirat [6d\]: It can be even slower
lucasr [5d\]: maybe 30 sec 
pirat [6d\]: yes
pirat [6d\]: it better
lucasr [5d\]: slower than that its really hard to find game on kgs haha
pirat [6d\]: haha
pirat [6d\]: yes
lucasr [5d\]: u know alldur?
pirat [6d\]: yes
lucasr [5d\]: idk why i always lose to him
lucasr [5d\]: i feel my fighting is stronger than his but i always lose him for some reason
pirat [6d\]: I also lost to him recently
lucasr [5d\]: u are stronger than him im sure
lucasr [5d\]: his style is wierd
pirat [6d\]: I would have won if we had played with komi
lucasr [5d\]: almost all of my games komi doesnt matter haha
pirat [6d\]: i lose 5,5
lucasr [5d\]: its either win big or lose big
pirat [6d\]: haha
lucasr [5d\]: out of 100 games maybe 5 of my games are within komi
lucasr [5d\]: HAHAHA
pirat [6d\]: It sounds funny, but considering your level of play, it's sad right now.
lucasr [5d\]: what do u mean?
lucasr [5d\]: like for 5d level?
pirat [6d\]: about the fact that usually games end with admitting your defeat to someone, but due to your score, they end with your defeat now
pirat [6d\]: That's what I mean.
lucasr [5d\]: i dont understand what u are saying
pirat [6d\]: oh
lucasr [5d\]: are u saying that usually i win other players , but now im losing to the same players?
pirat [6d\]: idk how to say 
pirat [6d\]: yes
pirat [6d\]: That's what I mean.
lucasr [5d\]: yeah
lucasr [5d\]: everyone has periods where they play badly
lucasr [5d\]: but i think even if im playing well u are stil stronger than me
lucasr [5d\]: for slow game
pirat [6d\]: Yes, but there are also periods when you play very well.
lucasr [5d\]: if im playing well my fighting is strong
pirat [6d\]: maybe
lucasr [5d\]: but my endgame and opening are weak
lucasr [5d\]: actually i dont know alot of josekis
lucasr [5d\]: i like to just fight straight away
pirat [6d\]: maybe it is necessary to correct these problems?
lucasr [5d\]: the josekis take so long to learn
pirat [6d\]: haha
lucasr [5d\]: for the complicated ones
lucasr [5d\]: theres one that gaopo always plays
pirat [6d\]: i too like that 
lucasr [5d\]: and i get tricked by him alot
